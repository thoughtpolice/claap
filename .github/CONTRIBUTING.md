# Contributing

## Commits

Rules for contribution:

  * 80-character column maximum.
  * The first line of a commit message should be 73 columns max.
  * Always run tests. If benchmarks regress, give OS information, and we'll
    discuss.
  * Always reference the issue you're working on in the bug tracker in your
    commit message, and if it fixes the issue, close it.

You can use GitHub pull requests OR just email me patches directly (see `git
format-patch --help`,) whatever you are more comfortable with.

One nice aspect of submitting a pull request is
that [travis-ci.org](http://travis-ci.org) bots will automatically merge, build
and run tests against your commits, and continue as you update the request, so
you can be sure you didn't typo stuff or something before a final merge.

For multi-commit requests, your code may get squashed into the smallest possible
logical changes and commiting with author attribution in some cases. In general,
try to keep the history clean of things like "fix typo" and "obvious build break
fix", and this won't normally be necessary.

### Notes on sign-offs and attributions, etc.

When you commit, **please use -s to add a Signed-off-by line**. `Signed-off-by`
is interpreted as a very weak statement of ownership, much like Git itself: by
adding it, you make clear that the contributed code abides by the project
license, and you are rightfully contributing it yourself or on behalf of
someone. You should always do this.

This means that if the patch you submit was authored by someone else -- perhaps
a coworker for example that you submit it from or you revive a patch that
someone forgot about a long time ago and resubmit it -- you should also include
their name in the details if possible.
